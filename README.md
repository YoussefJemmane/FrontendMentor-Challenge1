## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I use Custom css in tailwind it's my first time using it and I really like it.

```json
theme: {
    extend: {
      colors:{
        lightgrey :"hsl(212, 45%, 89%)",
        white: "hsl(0, 0%, 100%)",
        grayishblue: "hsl(220, 15%, 55%)",
        darkblue:"hsl(218, 44%, 22%)",
      },
      fontFamily: {
        'outfit': ['"Outfit"', 'sans-serif'],
      },
      fontSize: {
        p:"15px",
      },
      screens: {
        mobile: "375px",
        desktop: "1440px",
      },
    },
  }
```

### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable with getting the colors from the style-guide.md file and I want to improve my skills in tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://tailwindcss.com/) - The Tailwind documentation helped me a lot to understand how to use custom css.
